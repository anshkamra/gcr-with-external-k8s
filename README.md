#If you run Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google Cloud Registry (GCR) support should be automatic. You must still make sure, however, that your instance has the correct permissions to access your private images. For details, see Using Container Registry with Google Cloud Platform. To connect to GCR from an environment other than GCP, you add an ImagePullSecrets field to the configuration for a Kubernetes service account. This is a type of Kubernetes secret that contains credential information.
